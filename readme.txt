I attemped to make this app functional but I could not get firebase to work. Even with public access it was still giving me a permission error. I was able to come up with a pretty good mockup of how the site would work, including it calculating minutes left using momentjs's diff function.

Initially, I tried using a method which finds all the numbers from the inputted time and creates a string. It then creates another string from the current time and subtracts that string from it. This poses a new problem, however, in that this number isn't accounting for 60 minutes being in an hour. To combat this, it multiplies the result by 0.6 to get the minutes left time. I used this strange method because I was unable to get moment to subtract properly and the method I made gave a generally similar emulation of how it would work using moment, however this method was buggy and would not consistently give reliable results.

If firebase were to work, I would send the submitted data to firebase and it would instantly retrieve it and append the data to its corresponding divs. This would be advantageous in that the data would be constant and would not delete iteself upon exiting out the webpage because it would be stored externally. I would also code a method to make the minutes left div update dynamically so it actually counts down. To do this, I would store the "timelefts" to an array and, using a timer and the .map functionality, I would set it so that every minute it subtracts one from each ite in the timelefts array. It would then send this updated data to firebase and then retrieve it, clear the div, and append the new, revised data to the div.
